# FaceDetectionCNN
## Overview
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to perform face detection and multi-task classification, including gender prediction, emotion recognition, and age estimation. The system demonstrates deep learning applications in computer vision, offering real-time facial analysis.

## Features
* Gender Classification: Predicts the gender of the detected face (e.g., male, female).
* Emotion Detection: Classifies the detected face into one of several predefined emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).
* Age Estimation: Predicts the approximate age of the detected face.
## Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow/Keras
* OpenCV for real-time video processing
* CNN architectures for feature extraction
